title: Asynchronous Transformations

### transforms: ["w=100&h=100", "w=200&h=200"]

Along with the file, pass the transformation options in the form with the key **transforms.** Immediately after the file is uploaded, its transformation will begin.

The options are formatted in the same way as when performing a transformation with a query request.

To get two new files with sizes 100x100 and 200x200, you need to pass the following options:

export const exampleCodeCurl = `curl --location 'https://api.defaultuploader.com/v1/upload' \
--header 'Authorization: YOUR_SECRET_CLIENT_TOKEN' \
--form 'file=@"/C:/Users/UserName/Pictures/Saved Pictures/cat.jpg"' \
--form 'transforms="[\"w=100&h=100\",\"w=200&h=200\"]"'`;

export const fileName = 'bash';

<Code code={exampleCodeCurl} lang="sh" title={fileName} />

As a result, there will be 3 files in the bucket:

<FileTree>
  - bucket/ — root folder of the bucket
    - image — file type (image, video, audio, etc.)
      - jpg — file extension
      - file_name.jpg — original file
      - file_name.jpg_w=100&h=100 — transformed file with dimensions 100px
      - file_name.jpg_w=200&h=200 — transformed file with dimensions 200px

</FileTree>

<Aside title="One of the Best Architectural Solutions" type="tip">
  In this way, all files with the specified parameters will be immediately available, and no time will be needed for their transformation.

  Using this functionality, you can implement an <a href="../../start/cdn/#maximizing-benefits-from-default-uploader">architecture</a> with the most efficient use of resources.
