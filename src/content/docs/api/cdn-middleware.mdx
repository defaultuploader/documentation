## Introduction

Default Uploader acts as middleware between the CDN and your application. This functionality allows you to optimize your files in the simplest way possible.

## Setup

<Steps>
  1. Create a subdomain for your media files with your CDN provider and set the origin to api.defaultuploader.com.
  2. In your application, set the file address using the **cdn** subdomain.
  3. Configure default optimization settings for all files in your personal account.
</Steps>

The subdomain can be either a SECRET_KEY or another value that can be set in your personal account.

## Example

```
// before
<img src="https://site.com" />

// after
<img src="https://cdn.site.com" />

// for example, if the default settings include [quality=75, format=auto]
The image has been optimized and converted to the optimal format for the browser making the request.
```
