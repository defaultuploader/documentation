## Fetching Images by URL

This method allows you to download an image from a specified URL and apply necessary transformations (such as resizing, optimization, and other parameters).

### Usage

Specify the remote file URL and the required parameters in the request URL.

Request format:
```
GET /v1/image/fetch/{remote-file-url}
```

### Example

Suppose you need to fetch an image from `https://hot-dogs.com/holy-pick.jpg` and resize its width to 100 pixels. The request would look like this:

```
https://api.defaultuploader.com/v1/image/fetch/{CLIENT_TOKEN}/https://hot-dogs.com/holy-pick.jpg?w=100
```

### Limitations

  Rate-limit: 50 requests per 5 seconds (can be increased upon request).

## Saving Fetched Files to S3 <Badge text="Coming soon" variant="tip" />

You can configure whether fetched files should be saved to S3 storage. There are two options:

1. **Enable auto-save in your account settings**: All files fetched via `/fetch` will be automatically stored in your S3 storage.
2. **Use a dedicated endpoint**: If auto-save is disabled, you can explicitly save a specific file by using the `/fetch/keep` endpoint:

```
GET https://api.defaultuploader.com/v1/image/fetch/keep/{CLIENT_TOKEN}/https://hot-dogs.com/holy-pick.jpg?w=100
```

This approach allows for flexible control over which files should be stored.
