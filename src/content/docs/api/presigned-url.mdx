title: Presigned URL for File Upload

---

With a presigned URL, you can securely upload files from any site without authentication!

Create a temporary link with a custom path.

export const code = `
# expirationIn - value in seconds
/v1/sign/SECRET_CLIENT_TOKEN/CUSTOM_PATH_FOLDER?expirationIn=3600
`

<Code code={code} lang="sh" title="METHOD: GET" />

You will receive a link. Use the **PUT** method to send a file to this link, and it will be uploaded to your bucket without an authorization key.

```
// The path is encrypted in the link. Any modification to the link will result in a failed upload.
// Therefore, it is safe to share with third parties.

Example of a presigned URL:
https://api.defaultuploader.com/v1/upload/sign/huFtjXfdtfU8kzRB4roo2M  \

dsfs.fdsf?expirationIn=3600
```

<Aside title="Simplified Integration Option">
  You don't need to handle file transfers through your backend service.

  The scenario would look like this:
  - When your client wants to upload a file, they request a link from your backend.
  - Your backend requests a presigned URL with a 1-minute timeout (?expirationIn=3600) and a specific path — clientid/folder — from the Default Uploader service.
  - Your backend then provides the link to the client, who uploads the file to your bucket using that link in the specified folder.

<Aside title="You can generate as many presigned URLs as you need" type="tip">
  But there are some limitations:
  - Maximum duration: 604800 seconds (1 week)
  - Rate limit: 1000 links per hour (can be increased upon request)
  - Maximum URL length: 300 characters
