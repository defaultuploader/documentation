Enable this option in your dashboard to process files that were uploaded by another system. This is useful when you already have files uploaded and want to integrate Default Uploader into your application.

For example, if you have a bucket with files structured like this:

<FileTree>
  - bucket/ — root folder of the bucket
    - mysite.com — first level of nesting
      - cats — second level of nesting
        - image — third...
          - n... — any level of nesting
            - file.jpg — file name

</FileTree>

To retrieve a file, you need to construct a **GET** request:
- Insert the entire path from the root folder in the bucket after **CLIENT_TOKEN**.

<Code code="https://api.defaultuploader.com/v1/MIME_TYPE/upload/CLIENT_TOKEN/mysite.com/cats/image/n.../file.jpg" lang="sh" title="METHOD: GET" />

```
MIME_TYPE — you can specify any of (image | video | audio)
Transformations will work regardless of the specified value.
```

And with a simple addition of a parameter, you can easily transform the file!

<Aside title="Easy Migration from Third-Party Solutions">
  Cloudinary, Uploadcare, and other services allow you to create backups in your S3 storage on paid plans.
  All you need to do is connect this storage to Default Uploader, and you can use your resources much more efficiently!
