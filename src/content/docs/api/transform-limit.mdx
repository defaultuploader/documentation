title: Transformation Limits

---

import { Aside } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

In your Default Uploader dashboard, you can set a maximum number of transformations for a specific file type (image, video).

If the number of transformations has already reached the limit, the original file will be returned upon the next transformation request.

<Aside title="Protect Your Resources" type="tip">
  It is highly recommended to set a limit.

  This fully protects against API abuse.
  An attacker won't be able to spam your S3 with requests like ?w=100, ?w=101, etc.
