title: Should You Use Default Uploader?
---

Before diving into the details and starting to use Default Uploader, it’s important to ask yourself: do you really need this service? We live in a world where there are numerous tools for every task, and not every solution is suitable for all situations. Default Uploader is a powerful tool, but it is not a one-size-fits-all solution for all tasks related to uploading, optimizing, and transforming files.

This service was created with a specific philosophy: to give developers freedom of choice, eliminate vendor lock-in, and offer flexibility in using different storage options and CDNs. However, this doesn’t mean it will be the best option for every project. Perhaps another solution that is already integrated into your infrastructure, meets your needs, and doesn’t require additional integration would be a better fit.

I am not trying to push you to use Default Uploader. On the contrary, I encourage you to carefully evaluate your needs and consider alternative options. It’s important to understand that every project is unique, and one solution doesn’t always fit all tasks. In the following articles, I will thoroughly analyze various use cases and try to help you determine which solution is best suited for your goals.

Remember, the goal is not just to choose a new tool, but to find something that truly optimizes your development process and improves your application’s performance. Whether it’s Default Uploader or another service, the main thing is to make a choice that will bring the most benefit to your project.
