title: Motivation
---

When I started working on Default Uploader, I had a simple yet ambitious goal: to make the world a little better by simplifying the lives of developers. Tasks related to uploading, optimizing, and transforming files may seem trivial at first glance, but they require significant effort and resources. I wanted to create a service that would become the standard for these tasks, freeing programmers from vendor lock-in and giving them the freedom of choice, which can significantly reduce costs.

Inspired by services like Cloudinary, Imgix, and Uploadcare, I realized that achieving global popularity required more than just another tool for working with images and files. Existing solutions are excellent, but they impose certain limitations, forcing users to depend on a specific provider’s infrastructure. This not only limits developers’ flexibility but also increases their costs.

Default Uploader is conceived as an alternative to this approach. My goal is to create a service that is not just an “out-of-the-box” solution but also a platform that can be adapted to specific needs, providing cost savings and flexibility. I want every programmer, when working on their project, not to worry about how and where to store files but to be able to freely choose the best option for themselves.

Understanding that true global reach requires the service to be free or at least partially free, I strive to eventually offer core services at no cost. While I can’t afford to do this yet due to significant infrastructure expenses, it remains one of my main goals.

Default Uploader is my way of making the world a little better. I believe that by providing developers with a tool that simplifies their work and reduces costs, I contribute to the development of accessible software. And although there are still many obstacles ahead, I will strive to make Default Uploader a standard in its field, helping programmers around the world realize their ideas with minimal costs and maximum freedom of choice.
