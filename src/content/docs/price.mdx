  New accounts get 100 GB of traffic and one hour of file processing for free.
</Aside>

Default Uploader uses a pay-as-you-go model, where costs are calculated based on the resources consumed:

- **Traffic:** $0.01 per gigabyte. Traffic is counted when uploading or downloading a resource from storage.
- **CPU time:** $0.0001 per second of file processing..

<Aside title="Payment Threshold">
  Initially, the payment threshold is set at $20. You can use the service up to this threshold without payment or card attachment.

  This is enough for 2 TB of traffic or 55 hours of CPU time.

### Cost Estimation for a Project with Default Uploader, S3, and Yandex Cloud CDN

For a project with 200 GB of traffic per month, 50 GB of S3 storage, and 3,600 seconds of CPU time, the cost breakdown is as follows:

- Assuming the CDN handles 90% of requests: 180 GB × $0.01/GB = $1.80.
- Default Uploader (20 GB traffic + CPU): 20 GB × $0.01/GB + 3,600 seconds × $0.0001/second = $0.56.
- Yandex Cloud S3 (storage and PUT/POST/PATCH operations, etc.): $0.98 + $0.048 + $0.0195 = $1.05.

> Total: $1.80 (CDN) + $0.56 (Default Uploader) + $1.05 (S3) = **$3.41 per month.**
