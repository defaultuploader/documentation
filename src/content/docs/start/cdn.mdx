Default Uploader does not have its own CDN, so to maximize the efficiency of the service, it is recommended to route your traffic through a CDN to Default Uploader.

<Aside type="caution" title="Important">
  For production use, it is strongly recommended to connect a CDN.
  * In the CDN settings, ensure that query parameters are not ignored.
  * By default, the service returns the file with a cache lifetime header of 30 days for successful responses.

## CDN Integration Diagram

### Best Solution for Business
The optimal way to use the service is to direct the CDN to https://api.defaultuploader.com.
This will allow you to take full advantage of dynamic transformation and resource optimization without the need for complex configuration of your application.

### Maximizing Benefits from Default Uploader
Direct your CDN to object storage and upload files with asynchronous transformation.
All subsequent requests for files will be handled only by your CDN, without using Default Uploader's resources.

<Aside type="caution" title="Attention">
  Note that in this scenario, on-the-fly optimization does not work.
