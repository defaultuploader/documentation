To start using the service, you need to complete 2 mandatory steps:

### 1. Create an account in Default Uploader

You need to create an account on the admin page [admin.defaultuplloader.com](https://admin.defaultuploader.com)

### 2. Connect an S3 storage to the service

On the admin page, you need to fill in the **Settings for connecting S3 and CDN** section.

<Aside type="tip" title="Boost your CDN">
Point your CDN to Default Uploader with API_KEY as a subdomain or specify the HOST in the settings in your personal account and use the service without S3!

```
// CDN settings
domain          origin
cdn.site.com    api.defaultuploader.com
```

In your application, change the URL for your images and videos.
```
https://sitename.com/image.jpg -> https://cdn.sitename.com/image.jpg
